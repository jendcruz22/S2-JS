<!-- Attribute data types for DTDs are:
- CDATA (character data)
- ID (unique value following XML naming rules, so ID wouldn't work for id attribute in this case because it's a number)
- IDREF (a reference to an ID)
- ENTITY (you would probably not use this one)
- NMTOKEN (string tokens, where multiple values are separated with spaces) -->
