<!-- ELEMENT_DEFINITION ELEMENT_NAME (CONTENT) -->
<!ELEMENT people (person*)>
<!ELEMENT person (name, bio?)> <!-- contents with a sequence (using commas), the order in which the element appears must be followed -->

<!-- Attribute data types for DTDs are:
- CDATA (character data)
- ID (unique value following XML naming rules, so ID wouldn't work for id attribute in this case because it's a number)
- IDREF (a reference to an ID)
- ENTITY (you would probably not use this one)
- NMTOKEN (string tokens, where multiple values are separated with spaces) -->

<!-- ATTRIBUTES CAN BE #REQUIRED OR #IMPLIED -->
<!ATTLIST person 
  id CDATA #REQUIRED
  salutation (Mr | Miss | Mrs | Lord | Lady | Sir) "Mr"
